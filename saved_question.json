{"difficulty": "medium", "Question": "Write a Python function that takes a sentence (string) as input and processes it according to the following rules:\n1. Split the sentence into individual words based on spaces.\n2. For each word, check its length. If the word has an odd number of characters, reverse the word.\n3. After any potential reversal (from step 2), capitalize the very first character of the word.\n4. Finally, rejoin the modified words back into a single sentence, preserving the original spacing between words. Punctuation attached to words should be considered part of the word for length calculation and reversal.", "Input": "A string representing a sentence, for example: `\"Python is a powerful programming language.\"`, `\"Hello world, this is a test sentence.\"`", "Output": "A string representing the processed sentence. For the input `\"Python is a powerful programming language.\"`, the output should be `\"Python Is A Powerful Gnimmargorp .Egaugnal\"`. For the input `\"Hello world, this is a test sentence.\"`, the output should be `\"Olleh World, This Is A Test .Ecnetnes\"`"}
