{"difficulty": "medium", "Question": "Using `matplotlib.pyplot` and `numpy`, generate 100 evenly spaced points for `x` between 0 and `2*pi`. Calculate `y1 = sin(x)` and `y2 = cos(x)`. Create a single plot where `y1` is plotted as a blue dashed line with circle markers and `y2` is plotted as a red dotted line with square markers. Add a legend with labels 'Sine Wave' and 'Cosine Wave'. Label the x-axis 'Angle (radians)' and the y-axis 'Amplitude'. Set the plot title to 'Sine and Cosine Waves Comparison'.", "Input": "None. The data for x, y1, and y2 should be generated within the solution using `numpy`.", "Output": "A Matplotlib plot displaying the sine and cosine waves on the same axes, with specified line styles, marker styles, colors, a legend, x and y axis labels, and a plot title."}
