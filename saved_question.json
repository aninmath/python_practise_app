{"difficulty": "medium", "Question": "Create a Matplotlib figure with two subplots arranged vertically (2 rows, 1 column). \n\nIn the **top subplot**:\n1. Generate 100 data points for `x` ranging from 0 to `2*pi`.\n2. Plot `y1 = sin(x)` as a blue dashed line and `y2 = cos(x)` as a red dotted line.\n3. Add a title 'Trigonometric Waves', an x-label 'Angle (radians)', and a y-label 'Amplitude'.\n4. Include a legend to distinguish between the sine and cosine plots.\n\nIn the **bottom subplot**:\n1. Generate 50 random integer data points for `x_rand` between 0 and 100, and 50 random integer data points for `y_rand` between 0 and 150.\n2. Create a scatter plot of `x_rand` against `y_rand` using green square markers.\n3. Add a title 'Random Data Scatter', an x-label 'X-values', and a y-label 'Y-values'.\n\nEnsure both subplots have appropriate spacing and the overall figure is saved as 'two_panel_plot.png'.", "Input": "No explicit input variables; all data should be generated within the script using `numpy` for trigonometric functions and `random` (or `numpy.random`) for scatter plot data.", "Output": "A PNG image file named 'two_panel_plot.png' displaying a Matplotlib figure with two vertically stacked subplots, each configured as described in the question."}
